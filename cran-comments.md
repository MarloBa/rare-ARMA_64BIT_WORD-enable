## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* corrected the C++ overruning issue for an R array.
* made sure the installation and check of the package can be completed within limited time under solaris system.
* made sure all URL for R packages are in canonical form.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.4
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
