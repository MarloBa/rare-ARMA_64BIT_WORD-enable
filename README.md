====

The R package implements the rare feature selection framework introduced in Yan, X. and Bien, J. (2018) "Rare Feature Selection in High Dimensions".

To install `rare` using the [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) R package, type

``` r
devtools::install_github("yanxht/rare", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

in R. This installs `rare` and builds its vignette. Learn to use `rare` with its vignette by typing

``` r
vignette("rare-vignette")
```

in R.
