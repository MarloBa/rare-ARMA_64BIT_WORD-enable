Title: Linear Model with Tree-Based Lasso Regularization 
       for Rare Features
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Xiaohan Yan [aut, cre], Jacob Bien [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Xiaohan Yan <xy257@cornell.edu>
Description: Implementation of an ADMM algorithm for fitting a linear model 
    with tree-based lasso regularization, which is proposed in Algorithm 1 
    of Yan and Bien (2018) "Rare Feature Selection in High Dimensions". The 
    package allows efficient model fitting on the entire 2-dimensional 
    regularization path for large datasets. The complete set of functions 
    also makes the entire process of tuning regularization parameters and 
    visualizing results hassle-free.
